###  How The Machine Learning Model Work
For Better Understanding How the Machine Learnibng model is Being Created .I am gona use a dataset Of blood Donation Campeign
This is dataset Of Donation Of blood Ny peope in March Moth 
![step1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83647407/230299722-dea98073-88dd-467d-9b30-10c230940773.png)

## Step1-:Convert All the column of the data into Numbercial Format since A machine learning alogirthm is based on numerical formula 
#### After COnverting the datset into Numercial column it is visible something like this-:

## Step 2-:Feature Selection-:In this step we Remove Unwanted Column from the Dataset 
#### In the following exmaple we can see column name-:Unamed:0 act as a index which would be irrevent in the Machine Learning Model So we rempve that column

## Step3-Choose a Model From The List of various Model
#### This is a List of Various Option Of machine leraning Model

## Step4-:Evaluate The Model 
#### In Regression Model we check The mean Squarred Error Of the model Lower is the value Higger is the accuracy,We can also Check r2 Score Higher the value of r2Score Higher is accuracy

##### In Classification Problem We Check The confusion Matrix And Classification Report Of the Model



## Step 5-: Choosing Hyperparemeter
#### After Choosing The Model We Do Hyperparamertering Of the Choosen Model To increase the Accury Of the Model As Heighest as Possible
